# DeepPSC
This package is a protein backbone structure reconstruction tool developed in: DeepPSC (protein structure camera): computer vision-based protein backbone structure reconstruction from alpha carbon trace as a case study.

It includes the PSC tool that convert PDB file of protein alpha-carbon trace to images, and a deep neural network architechture for protein backbone structure reconstruction based on converted images. Besides, the calculation of criteria and the pdb file list of datasets involved in our experiments are included.
