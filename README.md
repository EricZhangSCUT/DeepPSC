# DeepPSC
This package is a protein backbone structure reconstruction tool developed in: DeepPSC (protein structure camera): computer vision-based protein backbone structure reconstruction from alpha carbon trace as a case study.

It includes the PSC tool that convert PDB file of protein alpha-carbon trace to images, and a deep neural network architechture for protein backbone structure reconstruction based on converted images. Besides, the pdb file list of datasets involved in our experiment is included.
